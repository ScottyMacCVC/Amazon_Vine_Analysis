# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Our task is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The service provides manufacturers and publishers a direct way to receive reviews of their products. For a small fee, Amazon will connect end users to products under the Amazon Vine membership. Members are required to give reviews and feedback on all products received through the program. Our goal is to access 50-or-so datasets, gather the review of a specific product, and perform an analysis. The analysis is a combination of ETL through PySpark, connection to Amazons' AWS RDS database instance, and then loaded into pgAdmin. We will take the data and determine whether there is bias toward favorable reviews. 

### Results - We will directly answer the questions below:

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
